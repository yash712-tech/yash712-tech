🔍 **About Me**

A data enthusiast driven by curiosity, persistence, and a love for solving real-world problems through data.

Currently in the final semester of my MSc in Data Analytics & Information Systems Management. 
I’ve worked across diverse domains — from detecting skin conditions and analyzing bone fractures to improving flood detection using satellite imagery. 
My thesis centers on evaluating machine learning models to enhance early flood prediction using Ensemble Learning.

I may not have all the answers — but I bring a curious mind, a collaborative spirit, and a strong drive to grow, contribute, and build impactful solutions with data.
